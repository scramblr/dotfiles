# scramblr's dotfiles
Hello. This is a place where I'm going to be dropping some of my more useful dotfiles. I probably won't drop my shell dotfile, because it's vanilla and that's really something that everyone eventually figures out how to do, and is very much a "personal choice" when it comes to displaying your command line. Anyways, here's some more dotfiles that will either expand a tool's functionality or at least display more for tools and/or things that you might not have realized are even there. 

LAST UPDATE JULY 24 2023

Added HTOP .config/htop/htoprc that activates a bunch of stuff that isn't turned on by default, but that I find extremely useful. 
  - NOTE: In addition to the dotfile, there's a few commands that you can enter inside of HTOP, that are also very useful:
    - 's' for strace output of any givin PID
    - 'l' list all open files (and open ports!) via LSOF output
    - '
